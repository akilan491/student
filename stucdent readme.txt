🧮 Student Grading System
📖 Overview
The Student Grading System is a simple web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to input a student’s name, roll number, and marks, then automatically calculates and displays the grade (A, B, C, or F) based on the marks entered.
